## Run the services in background

You can easiluy run Docker compose files in background using so-called daemon-mode (`-d` flag)

Let's do so:

`docker-compose run -d`

## Check the health and the logs

You can use `docker-compose ps` for the status of the containers and `docker-compose logs` to see the logs.
